# php-web-scraper-boilerplate
My PHP based web scraper code boilerplate

I love to do web scraping in this pure way. No need any kind of "bulky" and "need-more-time to learn" third-party libraries.

## Preparation
- Latest PHP should be installed, I prefer >= 7.3
- php-xml extension should be installed, for DOM operation
- php-curl extension should be installed, for grab the text content from the web
